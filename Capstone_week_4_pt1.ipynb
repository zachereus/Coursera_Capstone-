Specifically, the analysis will determine the closest neighborhood in Brooklyn relative to Manhattan, with the lowest number of existing hotels. The results of this report can be used as a reference by hotel stakeholders who are interested in building a hotel in Brooklyn for Manhattan bound travelers. "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Background "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### In New York City, the borough of Manhattan is an important location for many groups of individuals and businesses. Aside from being a financial hub for thousands of business travelers each year, it is also a prime destination for millions of tourists traveling to New York City annually. This has resulted in the cost of hotels in Manhattan being exponentially higher than that of the neighboring boroughs. \n\n### One option to alleviate this problem for travelers is to build a hotel in the less expensive boroughs of Bronx, Brooklyn, or Queens. From there, travelers can book a hotel in a neighboring borough and commute to downtown Manhattan. It is important to build a hotel as close to downtown Manhattan as possible, as to reduce travel time and cost. \n\n### For a hotel builder, knowing the optimal neighborhood in a neighboring borough to build the hotel is key to solving these problems. By knowing the best neighborhood to build the hotel, Manhattan bound travelers can reduce booking costs, travel time, and overall travel cost. Additionally, knowing the number of existing hotels within the neighborhood in question and where they are located can minimize competition from other hotels in that area. \n\n### This project will focus on finding the optimal neighborhood in the Brooklyn borough.
